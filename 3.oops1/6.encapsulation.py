#encapsulation
# Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
# It describes the idea of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that work on that data within one unit, like a class.

    def __init__(self,name ,car):
        self.__name = name 
        self.__car = car
